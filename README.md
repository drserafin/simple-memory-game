# simple-memory-game
A simple and interactive memory matching game where two players take turns flipping cards to find matching pairs. The game features a responsive grid of cards with different images on the back, and the goal is to match the cards by flipping them over. The leaderboard tracks the scores of Player 1 and Player 2, and the game can be reset at any time.
